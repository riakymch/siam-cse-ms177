## Abstract

The energy consumption constraint for large-scale computing encourages scientists to revise the architecture design of hardware but also applications, algorithms, as well as the underlying working / storage precision. The main aim is to make the computing cost sustainable and apply the lagom principle ('not too much, not too little, the right amount"), especially when it comes to working / storage precision. Therefore, in this minisymposium, we address the issue of sustainable computations from the perspective of computer arithmetic tools; re-design of algorithms and high performance applications with low and mixed precision; but also novel ways of rounding numbers like stochastic rounding and the probabilistic (aka optimistic) error analysis, which is more realistic and closely captures the actual computed errors. Such techniques help reducing the precision during computations in a controllable way, and are an important step towards sobriety in the usage of computing resources.
